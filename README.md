## Quickstart

### Install Dependencies

Run `npm install` to install all required Dependancies. The app will throw some warnings regarding:

```

```

@angular-bootstrap-md will warn you of unmet dependancies however, the application will still work and buid - Upon reading their documentation:

>Warnings will disappear as soon as 3rd party libs will release their updates for Angular 5. From our side, we have tested our package against Angular 5 and we can confirm that those warnings donâ€™t affect the functionalities so you can ignore them as Angular 5 is backwards compatible with Angular 4. As a result, thus 3rd party plugins are working correctly with Angular 5, however warning that they have been fully tested with Angular 4.0.3.
